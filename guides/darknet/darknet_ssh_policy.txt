       DarkNet SSH Policy - s0ttle

Date: 8 August 2008
  To: DarkNet SAs (System Administrators)

SUBJECT: DarkNet Secure Shell Policy

PURPOSE: The purpose of this document is to outline the baseline
         policy for configuring and securing secure shell access.

SCOPE: 
	o Configuration
	o Maintaining Security
	o Maintaining Availability
	o Providing Support
	o Restrictions


CONFIGURATION

I.   The following configuration will be used in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

	Port 7888 
	Protocol 2
	Listen Address x.x.x.x
	HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
	UsePrivillegeSeparation yes
	Strict Modes yes
	LoginGraceTime 30
	MaxAuthTries 4
	AllowUsers cytrix s0ttle ghimire duder
	PubkeyAuthentication yes
	ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
	AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys2
	Subsystem   sftp    /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server
	IgnoreRhosts yes
	HostbasedAuthentication no
	IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes
	PermitEmptyPasswords no
	PermitRootLogin no
	PasswordAuthentication no
	RhostsRSAAuthentication no
	X11Forwarding no
	MaxStartups 5
	UsePAM no

II.  The remaining configuration options should be deleted. Site
     specific settings should be submitted for review to ensure they
     do not reduce the effectiveness of the above configuration.


MAINTAINING SECURITY

I.   In order to mitigate inadvertant or intentional modification(s)
     to the configuration files each SA needs to ensure the following
     precautions are in place:

	A.  Set the immutable flag: chattr +i /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	B.  Set Permissions:

		sshd_config		0400
		ssh_hosts_rsa_key	0600   
		authorized_keys2	0400

		~/.ssh			0755
		/etc/ssh		0755
		/usr/sbin/sshd		0555


II.  Monitoring authentication success and failure will keep you abreast 
     of emerging attack trends and allow for feedback on the implemented
     security policy. Based on your OS one of the following files should
     be mailed and audited at least once per week:

	/var/log/secure || /var/log/authlog	


III. Keep a sha1sum of the sshd binary offsite (audit weekly).

	e0a20319bf8c15ce2da80bf100c6b79c26a2e154  /usr/sbin/sshd


MAINTAINING AVAILABILITY

I.   In order to maximize access availability to the DarkNet (DN) each SA is
     responsible for monitoring security, configuration, and connectivity of
     their respective secure shell daemon.

II.  The following areas should be of primary concern for each DN SA: 
    
     	o Ensure sshd is active and accepting remote connections 
     	o Verify sshd is bound to the configured interface and port
        o Check authentication messages are being logged
     
III. This policy does not strictly require the implementation of third party
     or native software that performs blocking, blacklisting, whitelisting,
     rerouting, or dynamic ingress/egress modification. However, if the SA's
     local policy requires the use of such software or features then a 
     contingency access plan must be submitted for review.


PROVIDING SUPPORT

I.   Each SA will be required to provide support for their respective secure 
     shell daemon. Support includes, but is not limited to connection settings
     and authentication issues.

II.  A secondary SA must be identified who has the necessary capacity to
     address issues relating to the secure shell daemon.


RESTRICTIONS

[+] Local policy will NOT override or lower the standards set in this policy.
[+] Distribution of this policy letter outside the DN is strictly prohibited.
[+] Only the digitally signed copy of this policy letter is approved for use.  



This policy will be reviewed monthly for compliance, changes, or updates.
