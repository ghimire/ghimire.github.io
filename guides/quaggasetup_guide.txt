===Quagga Installation/Configuration For Darknet - Quick-HowTO (ghimire)===

[[http://openmaniak.com/quagga_pre.php|Openmaniak.com]] has an excellent [[http://openmaniak.com/quagga.php|Quagga]] walk-through and tutorials. Please refer the site for advanced installation and configuration options. For our purpose we will install quagga and configure it to run ospfd.

> Debian/Ubuntu
apt-get install quagga
> Gentoo
ghimire quagga
> Archlinux
pacman -S quagga
> FC/RedHat/SuSE
yum install quagga
> FreeBSD
cd /usr/ports/net/quagga && make ENABLE_USER=root ENABLE_GROUP=wheel install


  * After quagga is installed, start the zebra service with

/etc/init.d/zebra start
  * Start ospfd service

/etc/init.d/ospfd start
  * Start vtysh on the terminal as root

sudo vtysh
  * This part can be a little tricky. Refer [[blocks]] page to check the blocks assigned to you. Let us assume you have been assigned 2.0.0.4/30 for client connection to bigbox and 2.0.2.0/24 for your openvpn server. We'll put 2.0.2.0/24 into area 1 instead of backbone area 0 in-order to reduce the LSA flooding transactions. Within **vtysh console** type in following commands in sequential order


 config t
 service password-encryption
 router ospf
 area 0.0.0.1 stub
 network 2.0.0.4/30 area 0.0.0.0
 network 2.0.2.0/24 area 0.0.0.1
 exit
 exit
 write

  * Make sure zebra and ospf services are started during startup sequence if you will be running openvpn server for other clients.
