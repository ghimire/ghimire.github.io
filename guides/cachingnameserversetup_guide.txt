===Darknet Caching Nameserver - ghimire===
Take a look at Running Chrooted Bind9 guide before this.

To run a caching Nameserver install bind9 (and preferably chroot it).
Modify /etc/bind/named.conf.options file and uncomment/modify these lines within options {};

        forwarders {
                50.9.0.1;
                50.5.0.1;
        };

Restart bind9.
Add "nameserver 127.0.0.1" as a first entry of /etc/resolv.conf file.

To verify your caching nameserver is working run:

dig +short wiki.bin

The output should match:
50.2.0.1
