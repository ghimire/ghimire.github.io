3. Update the deviceLicenseKeyIdentifier variable in the ZoomGlobalState.js with your ZoOm License Key Identifier from your account page - <https://dev.zoomlogin.com/zoomsdk/#/account.>
4. npm install
5. npm run facetec-browser-sdk
6. To build the TypeScript sample, you will need to open a new window and navigate to the sample-app-ts directory. Follow the steps in the README and close the window when finished. These steps build the TypeScript sample. If you make changes to the ts files, you will want to make sure to build again after modification.
