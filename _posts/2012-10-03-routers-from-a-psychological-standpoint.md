If I was little and somebody asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, I'd say a Router, not a cheap "Made in China" Huawei Router, but a decent Cisco made Router because routers are amazing creation of humankind and research. They always know best, even if they don't they give their best shot by utilizing routing protocols such as RIP, IGRP, OSPF, BGP, EIGRP. Giving up is merely word in a router's dictionary. They perform undaunted task of finding best possible route for packets that are lost and confused. As long as a datagram lives in the same subnet, router will show them the way for they do not know their destiny. Combined with access-lists they block evil in a blink of an eye. They know best not to forward broadcast packets. In a society full of crime and war, routers prevent collision by splitting collision domains. To a wanderer, router is a gateway of light and hope. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is router's greatest enemy. Nevertheless, a router fights back against such repulsive behaviors with courage and dignity in the form of null routing. Routers and switches go hand in hand in forming a stable network and uninterrupted services. Router is a great teamplayer with other network devices like repeaters, bridges and hubs.  

To sum up, routers make information sharing easy and painless as possible and guide otherwise chaotic networks to best possible optimized direction. It is routers that have brought millions of lives together and it is only fair that we continue studying and implementing them to create a bigger, better global network we are so fond of.
